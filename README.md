# Aleksei Kromski blog 🥳

## Description 📋
A simple web app to check the latest news from my life/projects. The system will support various types of filtering and searching, as well as comments on posts. On the admin side, there will be a simple CRUD application. The system will use self-written libraries (for example, the implementation of a router or storage).

Project goals:
  - Write your own implementation of many standard things and bring them to the ideal speed
  - Gain new knowledge in deploying a CI/CD application with kubernetes.
